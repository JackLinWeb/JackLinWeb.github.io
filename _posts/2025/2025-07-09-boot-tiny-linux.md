This post documents my steps of manually downloading, configuring, and compiling Linux kernel (v6.12) on an Ubuntu 24.04 machine.

## Installing Required Tools

To compile the Linux kernel, several development tools and libraries are needed. You can install them with the apt package manager:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git build-essential flex bison bc libncurses-dev libssl-dev libelf-dev
````

Brief explanation of each package:

* `build-essential`: Includes `gcc`, `make`, and other essential build tools
* `flex`, `bison`: Needed for building the configuration menu
* `bc`: A math utility used in kernel Makefiles
* `libncurses-dev`: Provides TUI interface for `make menuconfig`
* `libssl-dev`, `libelf-dev`: Required by some optional modules

## Downloading the Linux Kernel Source Code

I chose the latest mainline version, v6.12. Use the following command to clone it:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 --branch=v6.12 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
cd linux
```

The `--depth=1` option fetches only the latest commit, which makes the download faster.

## Generating a Minimal Configuration with tinyconfig

To quickly produce a minimal working kernel, I used `tinyconfig`:

```bash
make tinyconfig
```

This generates a `.config` file that enables only the most essential kernel features.

## Compiling the Linux Kernel

Now compile the kernel:

```bash
make -j$(nproc)
```

`$(nproc)` uses all available CPU cores for faster build.

After compilation, the output image will be located at:

```none
./arch/x86/boot/bzImage
```

`bzImage` is a bootable Linux kernel image, short for "big zImage". It is a self-extracting compressed format mainly used for x86/x86\_64 architectures.

You can check its file type with:

```bash
file arch/x86/boot/bzImage
```

## Booting the Kernel with QEMU

First, install QEMU:

```bash
sudo apt install qemu-system-x86
```

Then boot the kernel:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel arch/x86/boot/bzImage
```

Unfortunately, the screen only showed:

```
Booting from ROM...
```

And nothing else followedâ€”no kernel messages appeared. This usually means the kernel lacks the drivers necessary to output to the display.

> Tip: After clicking into the QEMU window, your mouse will be captured. Press `Ctrl + Alt + G` to release it.

## Configuring menuconfig

After closing the QEMU window, run `menuconfig` to modify kernel settings (make sure `libncurses-dev` is installed):

```bash
make menuconfig
```

**Enable TTY Support**

Navigate to:

```none
Device Drivers  --->
  Character devices  --->
    <*> Enable TTY
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blueskyson/image-host/master/2025/boot-tiny-linux-2.png)

> Use arrow keys to navigate and press `Y` or the spacebar to enable the option.

This setting enables support for TTY devices (i.e., text console and serial output).

**Enable printk Support**

Also enable the kernel logging mechanism:

```none
General setup  --->
  Configure standard kernel features (expert users)  --->
    [*] Enable support for printk
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blueskyson/image-host/master/2025/boot-tiny-linux-3.png)

Save your configuration and recompile:

```bash
make -j$(nproc)
qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel arch/x86/boot/bzImage
```

Now the terminal finally shows kernel boot messages. Although it ends with:

```
panic - not syncing: No working init found
```

we have successfully booted the kernel and verified output is working.

To fix this panic, you need to provide a valid `init` process (e.g., `systemd` or `busybox`). This will not be covered in this post.

If you want to reset your kernel configuration to a clean tinyconfig state for further experiments, use:

```bash
make mrproper
```

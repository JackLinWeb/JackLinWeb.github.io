## Analysis of Vulnerabilities

Despite many academic institutions and businesses conducting systematic analyses, there is currently no globally accepted standard for classifying blockchain vulnerabilities and attacks. This is because blockchain technology has been evolving rapidly, and new vulnerabilities and attack methods are constantly emerging, making it difficult to devise a complete and comprehensive classification standard.

After a thorough review of research papers, the 5-layer framework proposed by Zhou, Liyi, et al. "Sok: Decentralized finance (defi) attacks" 2023 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy presents the most comprehensive coverage of all vulnerabilities in blockchain, shown in the following table. We have opted to utilize this framework to categorize the vulnerabilities in DeFi, as it enables a more comprehensive and precise analysis.

### A. Network Layer (NET)

In the Network Layer, nodes communicate by transmitting messages through various network protocols, such as TCP/IP and DNS. Common incident types in this layer include:

**1\)** Network Transparency: Exposing transaction data to the public network could provide attackers with the opportunity to create counterfeit transactions. Blockchain systems should create secure TLS connections to miners, and confidentially share all credentials.

**2\)** Improper Peer Discovery: Peer-discovery may expose the location and identity of nodes, enabling attackers to pinpoint nodes, such as eclipse attacks. Attackers may also abuse poorly designed peer discovery algorithms to launch denial of service attacks.

**3\)** Network Congestion: This usually refers to denial of service attacks.

**4\)** Exposed Internet Services: A blockchain system must secure network access services to prevent BGP hijacking and DNS hijacking. This incident cause was first observed in an attack against MyEtherWallet. Due to a BGP flaw, an attacker can announce ownership of any prefix to its neighbor routers to redirect users to a fake website and compromise victimsâ€™ private keys.

### Consensus Layer (CON)

The Consensus Layer is used to determine which transactions are included in a block and to ensure the consistency and security of the blockchain. There are multiple algorithms for the Consensus Layer, such as Proof of Work (PoW) in Bitcoin, and Proof of Stake (PoS) in Ethereum. Common incident types in this layer include:

**1\)** Unstable Incentive Mechanism: Incident types in this category are quite diverse. All of them are enumerated below with brief explanations.
- Majority / 51% Attack: When a group of nodes controls over 50% of the total computing power of a blockchain, it allows them to rewrite blocks. Even if the group controls lower but close to 51%, they still have chances to overwrite blocks.
- Block Reorganization: When a block is removed from the blockchain due to a longer chain being discovered, it results in the loss of previously confirmed transactions. During the reorganization, attackers may exploit the asynchrony of information to launch attacks.
- Selfish Mining: A group of miners solves a hash, creates a new block, and keeps it hidden. This creates a fork, which is mined to surpass the public blockchain. If the group's chain outpaces the honest one, they overwrite the original blockchain.
- Double Spending: A user attempts to spend the same cryptocurrency twice. Though consensus algorithms prevent spending multiple times, this can occur in a majority / 51% attack.
- Feather Forking: A small group of nodes creates its own version of the blockchain. For instance, the group refuses to build on any chain that contains a block with the unwanted transaction. As long as this group has the longest fork path, all other honest miners may have a chance to include the forked chain in the main chain.
- Bribery Attacks: Bribe miners to manipulate blockchain consensus or transaction order, leading to attacks such as double spending, historical alterations, transaction delays, etc.
- Mining Difficulty Adjustment: Manipulating the rate of block creation.

**2\)** Unfair Sequencing: The attackers alter the sequencing of transactions to gain a favorable price. Or, they censor and obstruct the transactions of other users.

### Smart Contract Layer (SC)

Smart contracts are programs stored on blockchains to execute automatically when predefined conditions are satisfied. These conditions are typically based on the terms of an agreement or a specific workflow. In essence, smart contracts serve to eliminate the need for third parties or intermediaries in transactions.

The smart contract layer allows for the creation and deployment of smart contracts, enabling transaction-level atomic state transitions and storing various states of the blockchain system, such as users' cryptocurrency balances, cryptocurrency addresses, block numbers, and other relevant information. The most popular programming language for writing smart contracts is Solidity.

**1)** Untrusted Or Unsafe Calls: Smart contracts typically use external calls to interact with other smart contracts, external data sources, or users to achieve more complex functionality. However, this provides attackers with opportunities to embed malicious code logic.
- Reentrancy: Repeatedly calling a function within a smart contract before the initial function call is completed.
- Delegate Call / Code Injection: Delegate call is a low-level mechanism in Solidity that permits one contract to execute the code of another contract within the current context. This implies the data and state are shared with the called contract, potentially allowing attackers to bypass authorization checks or modify the state.

**2)** Coding Mistake: This refers to technical errors made by developers during the coding process, resulting in incorrect smart contract behavior, as opposed to design issues.

**3)** Access Control Mistake: Attackers utilize external calls, fallback functions, forged wallet addresses, etc. to bypass identity verification. Smart contract developers must ensure that resource access is properly authenticated by any means.

**4)** State Transition Design Mistakes: Each opcode supported by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is associated with a specific gas cost. These gas costs are designed to reflect the underlying resources consumed by each operation on the nodes that constitute the Ethereum network. A mismatch between the cost of an operation and the actual resource consumption (such as CPU time and memory) has several implications. It can be exploited for malicious purposes such as excessive block processing times and skewed block gas limits.

### Protocol Layer (PRO)

The protocol layer is a collection of standardized DeFi protocols that define basic rules to manage cryptocurrency. For instance, ERC-20 establishes the fundamental functionalities of cryptographic tokens, including token transfers, balance inquiries, and approvals. This means that despite belonging to different DeFi projects, all ERC-20-compliant tokens are compatible with each other, which promotes interoperability between DeFi protocols.

**1\)** Transaction Order Dependency Mistake: An agent can benefit from front-running by gaining early knowledge of pending transactions and strategically setting a higher gas fee to prioritize their own transaction execution before the victim's transaction. This unfair practice allows the agent to obtain more favorable outcomes while causing losses to other participants. Similarly, in back-running or sandwiching, an agent intentionally places its own transaction orders around the target transaction to manipulate the price.

**2\)** Replayable Design: Replicating a transaction executed on one blockchain to another blockchain. This attack is commonly observed during cryptocurrency forks or when transactions are not specific to a particular chain.

**3\)** Block State Dependency Mistake: Block states such as `block.blockhash` or `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by malicious miners, so a contract shouldn't use block states for decision-making. Neither should they use block states as random seeds.

**4\)** Permissionless Interaction: Victims only constrain the function interface of a contract, without considering how the contract is implemented. As a result, attackers exploit contracts that comply with the accepted ABI interface but contain incompatible implementation logic, causing harm.

**5\)** Unsafe Dependency: The reliance on external protocols or some standards provides attackers with more attack vectors. For example, attackers can exploit the quotes provided by an oracle to manipulate prices. They can also acquire a sufficient amount of governance tokens to propose and execute malicious contract code.

**6\)** Unfair or Unsafe Interaction: Participants can obtain more favorable prices via unfair slippage protection or unfair liquidity. Unsafe or infinite token approval refers to a protocol granting approval for an unlimited or excessively high number of tokens to another address or contract.

### Auxiliary Service (AUX)

The functionalities that do not belong to the first four layers are classified as the Auxiliary Service Layer, including website management, code/contract deployment, etc. These services typically do not directly participate in the operation of the blockchain system, but they provide necessary support and management to make the blockchain system more user-friendly. In general, vulnerabilities in the auxiliary service layer are usually caused by backdoors, phishing, or trust in malicious data sources.

Some visual records from attending IEEE ICBC 2024 (International Conference on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency).

The conference was held at Trinity College Dublin, where scholars, researchers, industry experts, and blockchain enthusiasts from around the world gathered. Dublin, with its rich historical culture and modern technological atmosphere, added a unique charm to the conference. Attendees were not only able to absorb the latest technological knowledge during the sessions but also had the opportunity to explore this beautiful city and experience the warmth of Ireland during their free time. The topics submitted for this conference included research focusing on the underlying sharding, DAG, and IoT of decentralized systems; analyses on various characteristics such as blockchain decentralization, NFT value, and performance; and studies related to blockchain security, CBDC, regulatory frameworks, and finance.

I won't be including the slides from other seminar presentations here, as the full papers can be read on the IEEE website. The rest of the content will be images and videos from exploring Dublin.

O'Connell Street is the main thoroughfare in Dublin's city center, filled with numerous landmarks and attractions. At the southern end of the street stands the monument to Daniel O'Connell, a prominent Irish nationalist leader. In the middle of O'Connell Street is the famous Spire, a 120-meter-high steel needle structure symbolizing Dublin's modernization. Along the street, there are many historic buildings, including the General Post Office (GPO), which was a key location during the 1916 Easter Rising. From O'Connell Street, a walk to Trinity College Dublin:

Trinity College Dublin was founded in 1592 by Queen Elizabeth I of England. The college's most famous attraction is the Old Library, completed in 1860. The Long Room, a two-story wooden room within the library, houses bookshelves filled with ancient books and busts of famous Western figures from various eras. Unfortunately, when I visited, they were in the process of digitizing their collection, so most of the books had been temporarily removed.

The library houses the Book of Kells, a masterpiece of medieval Irish culture and Christian art. This manuscript is a Latin copy of the four Gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Created around AD 800 by Irish monks, the Book of Kells is believed to have been produced at either Kells Abbey or Iona Abbey. The manuscript contains 2,000 illustrations and features exquisite ancient calligraphy for every word.

I also took advantage of the remaining spare time to visit the sea views of Howth Lighthouse.
